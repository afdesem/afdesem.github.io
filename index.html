          Artificial intelligence has severely impacted in human's daily lives, whether it is for work purposes, studies, researches, or even assistance. Although having a dependable and fair amount of advantages and purposes, AI systems could also send humanity into its demise, not talking a simple uneducated group of civilians, but worse. 
          First, we ought to know what really is ai from its definition. Although there has been a debate upon the mere definition of AI, <b>The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial intelligence</b> have provided us from a fair starting point.

          <i>
            “Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their 
environment and taking actions – with some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals. 
AI-based systems can be purely software-based, acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, 
image analysis software, search engines, speech and face recognition systems) or AI can be 
embedded in hardware devices (e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or Internet of 
Things applications).”
          </i>

        <p class="popup">
          That said, we could conclude that Artificial Intelligence are made merely to decide and act to achieve upon givem goals. So really AI could never make their own goals and decision, bot that they cant, but they know its not their job to, and has no capability to do so, since algorithms implemented inside Artificial Intelligence, are algorithms that has the purpose to reach certain goals.
        </p>
        <p class="popup">
          These Goals are set by the humans through a certain set of rules depending on what is the AI purpose, for instance chatGPT models are made to communicate, serve information and assistance upon human needs. Despite having such advantage upon human needs, these softwares and hardwares could lead to humanity's downfall.
        </p>
        <p class="popup">
          <i>"How?"</i> you may ask. As you have seen throughout these 5 years, the development of Artificial Intelligence has abruptly showed a significant evolution. Just in 2019 we only had cringy musics, furry cosplay videos with kakegurui sounds, and teenagers mimicking their favorite characters. this era changed drastically when chatGPT-3 was released. It's capabilities and assistances has brought professions into their success.
        </p>
        <p class="popup">
          Although, these <i>"assistance"</i> has taken a big toll on youth's productivity. Throughout the 5 years of evolution, chatGPT has evoluted to something akin to human, even surpassing us. Image generation, text and pragraph analyzation. All there features has gottem too much for humanity, that they made too much advantage on it.
        </p>
        <p class="popup">
          Without their awareness, these Artificial Intelligence learned by themselves. Although they do not learn like us do, learn and improve, no - they are incapable of "improving". They copy from thousands of sources and finaly achieve their goal, as i said before, AI are designed to decide upon actions to achieve assigned goals. This doesnt mean they care how they achieve it. They will just do it without caring how they do it.
        </p>
        <p class="popup">
          Thus, let us wisely learn and decise by ourselves before relying on such tools, as if we cannot do it ourselves. The overflowing advantages humanity took upon Artificial Intelligences has risen the rate of unemployment. Without realizing it, we have destroyed ourselves. So let us decide for ourselves first before relying on something inhumane.
